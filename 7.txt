Experiment 7: program to implement Towers of Hanoi using python 
def towers_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
        return
    towers_of_hanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
    towers_of_hanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)

# Example usage
n = 3  # Number of disks
towers_of_hanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B')
Output:
1.	Move disk 1 from A to C
2.	Move disk 2 from A to B
3.	Move disk 1 from C to B
4.	Move disk 3 from A to C
5.	Move disk 1 from B to A
6.	Move disk 2 from B to C
7.	Move disk 1 from A to C
